Algorithm to simulate the forward migration of meandering river channels.

This code contains an algorithm to analyze and simulate the behavior of meandering river channel. It uses geospatial data and mathematical computations to model the river's future migration and creates a simulation of potential future changes in the river channel.

The code uses the Oulankajoki River as an example and the shapefiles used in this project are available in this repository.


Algorithm is part of Oona Oksanen's master's thesis.
